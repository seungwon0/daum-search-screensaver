Daum Search Screensaver
=======================

It installs Girl's Generation screensaver from Daum for Linux
automatically.

Girl's Generation(소녀시대) is a nine-member South Korean girl group.

Daum made this screensaver for their search engine promotion. They
provide this screensaver only for Windows and MAC, not Linux. :(
